        <p class="lead">The goal of the 2.2 by ‘22 initiative is to endow one full scholarship at a cost of R$2.200.000
          to the Graded Scholar Program by the year 2022.</p>
        <p>
          2.2 by ‘22 believes that socioeconomic diversity is crucial to develop empathy and help students make a
          lasting impact on society. By having students who are not only diverse in nationality, religion, culture but
          also socioeconomic backgrounds, all Graded students will be able to get wider, more holistic perspectives of
          the world and foster empathy.
        </p>
        <p>More importantly, though, the reason why 2.2 is so committed to raising R$2.2M isn’t only because it’s going
          to make students at Graded more empathetic. It’s because it’s the right thing to do. The majority of
          Brazilians don’t get the opportunities Graded students do. The only difference is how much money our parents
          have. 2.2 by '22 believes that giving determined Brazilian children a chance will cause an irreversible and
          positive change in their life and the lives of everyone that they come into contact with. That change will
          ripple throughout the next generations of the communities beyond our walls that the Graded Scholar Program
          touches.
