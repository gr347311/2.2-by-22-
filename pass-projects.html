          <p>2.2 by '22 began a Senior Gift project in 2019 where all graduating seniors are encouraged to donate to the Graded Scholar Program so that we may share the privilege that is a Graded education with others. Repeated in 2020, both the Class of 2019 and 2020 have jointly contributed over R$43,000. 
        </p>
            <p>Additionally, 2.2 by '22 wants to build a communal sentiment to give back to society through 2.2 by '22, thus we began a school fundraiser in November of 2019. The Graded Family Quiz Night was able to collect over R$10,000! With over 10 teams competing in answering questions from all genres, from history and math to pop culture and Graded trivia, the Quiz Night was an event that was enjoyed by parents, students, teachers and administrators! Unfortunately, due to the current pandemic, a Second Graded Family Quiz Night that was scheduled to have taken place in April 2020 was unable to occur. However, 2.2 by '22 is working diligently to provide donors with opportunities to donate even in isolation.
